# Ngozi Isiuwe's Yatzy Game Documentation

This documentation provides an explanation of my yatzy game and its rules. 


## **1. Explanation**
Players take turns rolling a total of five dice. After each roll, the current player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. The goal is to have a dice combination that gets you the highest score. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn. Each round, the player must fill a score box either with their score or zero if they were unable to get anything. This cannot be edited upon completion. The game ends when all score boxes are used. The player with the highest total score wins the game.


## **2. Scoring**

Ones: The sum of all dice showing the number 1.
