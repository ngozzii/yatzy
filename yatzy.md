# Ngozi Isiuwe's Yatzy Game Documentation

This documentation provides a clear and simplified overview of the design system used for my Yatzy game. It includes colors, typography, components, and layouts.

## **1. Color Palette**
This game design is inspired by the Lion King Hakuna Matata philosophy. I used cool colours for the background colours to establish a cool and relaxed vibe to embody the philosophy with neutral colours to fill the remainder of the space. The icons act as pops of colour to make the game more playful

- **Dice colour 1:** `#FFFFFF`
- **Dice colour 2:** `#000000`
- **Game board background:** `#D7E6F1`
- **Game board player slot outline:** `#1C8BDD`
- **Score board background:** `#F6F4F4`
- **Score board & game board text:** `#000000`
- **Score board table lines:** `#1C8BDD`
- **Roll button background:** `#04365B`
- **Roll button text:** `#FFFFFF`

## **2. Fonts**

- **Body Text:** `"Times New Roman", Times, serif`
- **Headers:** `"Times New Roman", Times, serif`

## **4. Components and Layout**
### Game Board
- **Design:** 
Structure - Organised with one player at the top, and the other player at the bottom. Each player will have an icon, and five empty slots beside their icon. This is where the dice they keep will be displayed. The background will be a pastel blue to immmitate the sky and the slots will be represented by dark blue square outlines. There will be a second dark blue border around the gameboard

Player icon - Players choose between 4 different animal icons. I chose animal icons because I feel it makes the game more playful. The animals will be characters from The Lion King that were present during the song Hakuna Matata. The Hakuna Matata philosophy is the base philosophy I utilized when designing the game. "Don't worry, be happy", this game is to let loose while still exploring your competitive side for the ultimate good vibes. The characters are Timon, Pumbaa, Simba, Nala.

Roll button - this is the button players click on to roll any dice they didn't keep. When rolling, the dice will have a little shake animation to simulate the process of rolling the dice. It will be black with white text

### Score Board
- **Design:** 
Background - light grey back ground with pastel blue lines and black text.Simple table format with each possible score combination and a total score for the rows, and a column for each player to tally their score.

### Dice design
- **Design:** White with black dots. I want to keep it standard to still maintain that digital board game effect. 

## **Conclusion**
This documentation serves as a concise reference guide for the design system used in the Yatzy game, aiming to facilitate development and maintain consistency in design throughout the project.
